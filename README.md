## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the app in Homey Pro:
```sh
homey app run
```


Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

## Usage

After installation, you can add your Echo devices to Homey:

1. Go to 'Devices' in the Homey app
2. Click the '+' button to add a new device
3. Select 'Echo by Amazon' from the list of apps
4. Follow the setup wizard to connect your Echo devices

### Amazon Domain
During the wizard you will have to choose which Amazon domain to use:

- North America (NA): used for amazon.com, amazon.ca, amazon.com.mx, amazon.com.br
- Europe (EU): used as default for most European countries
- Far East (FE): used for amazon.co.jp, amazon.com.au, amazon.com.in, amazon.co.nz

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your Echo devices are on the same network as your Homey Pro
2. Check that your Echo devices are updated to the latest firmware
3. Restart both your Homey Pro and Echo devices

### "Page not found" error when trying to connect to Amazon account
If you have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) turned on for your Amazon account, you might see a "page not found" error when connecting the app. To resolve this issue:
- Log into your Amazon account via a web browser
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Use an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator
- Use the code generated by the authenticator app, not the one Amazon texts to you

This solution should resolve the connection problem.

### Unstable connection and long response times
If when you update an Echo device the Homey app does not update or updates with a very long delay, try creating a new connection by changing the Amazon domain
